# PA2 - BFS
This assignment makes a connected graph and performs the BFS algorithm on it, and produces the output to a given outfile

## Files
List.c - contains functions needed to make a List ADT. Used in BFS for a queue<br>
List.h - header file for List.c and contains function delclarations for the List ADT <br>
Graph.c - contains functions needed to create graphs and define a Graph ADT <br>
Graph.h - header file for Graph.c and contains function declarations for the Graph ADT<br>
GraphTest.c - test file for Graph.c that ensures correct output of the functions<br>
FindPath.c - takes in an infile and outfile to print out a created graph and the shortest paths to certain vertices given that the BFS algorithhm was run<br>
Makefile - compiles and links the files, as well as creates an executable binary<br>
README.md - lists files and comments to grader<br>

## Comments
I am not sure which file to include for the check findpath section in the makefile, so I will push an example to the repo in order to satisfy that test condition.
