# PA4 - Matrix Representation
This assignment uses a Matrix ADT and creates a matrix and is capable of performing matrix operations

## Files
List.c - contains the List ADT that contains an array of nodes, which contain entries<br>
List.h - contains the function declarations for List.c<br>
Matrix.c - contains the Matrix ADT and contains the functions that allow for matrix operations<br>
Matrix.h - contains the function declarations for the Matrix.c<br>
Sparse.c - contains the main file that performs specific matrix operations on a matrix specified in the infile and outputs it to outfile<br>
MatrixTest.c - contains test functions for Matrix ADT<br>
ListTest.c - tests functions in List ADT<br>
Makefile - creates sparse executable and runs tests

## Comments
My sum and diff functions are not fully optimized, so my program does not pass Sparse Test 4 on the grading script, but it passes all of the other tests without memory leaks.
